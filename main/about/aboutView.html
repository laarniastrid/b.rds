            <h4>Hey there, just a little about me...</h4>
            <p>
              I'm a little weird, with a little bit of a weird sense of humor.
              I came up with the title [b.rds] when thinking on fun web projects
              to build.  This was also around the time where I was in a situation
              where I had to sell my 'kids', or rather my pet birds - several
              pairs of Peach Faced Lovebirds. They were sad days, but alas, I had
              to sell all my cute little feathered children and thought
              using [b.rds] as a title for a site about 'selling kids', was rather
              hilarious.  So inspired my site title!
            </p>
            <p>
              Hopefully the title description got your attention and you can
              learn a little more about Human Trafficking.  Depending where you
              live, you might think, 'oh no, that can't be near where I live'.
              However, even in the most unsuspecting places, Human Trafficking
              persists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyways, hope you like my little site so far, and feel free to support
              it by visiting the store! [Coming Soon] ... when it is up and running,
              a portion of sales will be donated to an organization dedicated to
              stopping Human Trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Farewell!
            </p>
