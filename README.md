# brds

## Things to note:
I'm learning to use bootstrap components on this site, so bootstrap stuff is pretty minimal.  Also, I apologize, but unfortunately 
the site so far doesn't have any media queries for mobile devices.  Once the MVP is completed, that will be my next step.

## About me:
Hey there, just a little about me...

I'm a little weird, with a little bit of a weird sense of humor. I can up with the title [b.rds] when thinking on 'fun' web projects 
to build. This was also around the time where I was in a situation where I had to sell my 'kids', or rather my pet birds. They were 
sad days, but alas, I had to sell all my children and thought it using [b.rds] as a title for a site about 'selling kids' was rather 
hilarious. So inspired my site title!

Hopefully the title description got your attention and you learn a little more about Human Trafficking. Depending where you live, you 
might think, 'oh no, that can't be near where I live'. However, even in the most unsuspecting places, Human Trafficking persists.

Anyways, hope you like my little site so far, and feel free to support it by visiting the store! [Coming Soon] ... when it is up and 
running, a portion of sales will be donated to an organization dedicated to stopping Human Trafficking.

Farewell!
